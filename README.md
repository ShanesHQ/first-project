today folks, we are selling kidneys! going to space isn't cheap

I will be using this as a journal of my thoughts so you can get a peek into my mind when im coding.

title of site is above the buttons, potentially could fix in css (most likely with an inline element or something of that nature, just need to rganise the classes well and shouldnt be an issue )

I know! I'll use a div for all the buttons in my nav bar and keep the spaceY logo/title seperate

maybe I dont need to i could move the title of the page out of the nav buttons and then class the nav maybe, lets see

edit: to get the effect of clicking a element and scrolling to that page i reckon ill use IDs and anchor tags 

mission 1: just get the text elements on the page
complete , 

now that's done I have used * in my css to for uniformed and consistent style (and to save time & repetition)

mission 2:the BGs (not the band)
just had to use w3 schools for syntax for url placement

weird white margin, hmm deffo usergen style sheet default or something??

thanks stack overflow - the answer seems so simple in hindsite lol but glad i got it solved efficiently

splash page looking saucy, im so glad i was already learning buttons before this course haha

next pages i want to be as efficient as possible.

attempted to solve how to move the piece of text/button div down without googling, troubleshooted and tweeked with pixels using drastic and then small changes, to see where the section moves and it disappears with too much but moves up with 20 more pixels as default setting, lightbulb! forgot we can use negative integers, Sorted.

page 2 looking good,

now going to attempt to build out the rest of the pages and press save when all is complete rather than 1 by 1, wish me luck

building a whole site seemed so daunting but as soon as your locked in, it's quite relaxing and weirdly calm, is this normal?????

gonna attempt a dropdown link

failed

but
all content is on and looks good 

now footer then finished
